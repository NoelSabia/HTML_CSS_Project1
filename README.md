### Typography impact:
-look for open shapes
-look for bigger intercharacter spaces
-look for unambiguous forms
-look for varying proportions
Switch between serif and san serif makes it more interesting also weight can make it more interesting

### Manage Attention of the reader:
1. Different Colors different importance
2. Layout is also an important eyechatcher
3. Use around 60 characters per paragraph (easier to read)
4. Alignement looks professional
5. Spacing makes it look more valuable
